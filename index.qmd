The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints is a church that [builds temples](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/temples/why-latter-day-saints-build-temples?lang=eng) in addition to local meetinghouses. An LDS temple is different from a regular, chapel-style meetinghouse. These building are considered sacred, and given their importance the LDS church has tried mightily to build them up to reduce drive times for church members.

I made the map below to find areas within a two hour drive of a temple[^1].

[^1]: Locations may not be exactly exact for recently announced temples.

Also, before temples are dedicated for use by church members, there is always an open house to the public. If you ever happen to have the chance to attend an LDS temple open house event, go.
